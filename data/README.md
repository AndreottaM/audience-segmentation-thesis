# MM-audiencesegmentation/data

Contains the data for each study of the project. Data from Qualtrics is stored in study-1.csv, study-2.csv, etc. Q sort data is stored in study-2-qsort.csv, study-3-qsort.csv, etc. For each study, the Qualtrics and Q sort data has been joined and renamed with more intuitive variables. This 'clean' version of the data can be found in the **../out** directory. The data dictionaries provide explanations for both the raw data (in this directory) and the clean data (in the **out** directory).
