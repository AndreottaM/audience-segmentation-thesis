**study1.qsf**: A Qualtrics file that may be imported into their system to reproduce the survey.

The original items used in the mental model scale is shown in **mental-model-scales.csv**. Some minor adjustments to spelling were made. The items of the scales were administered in a random order, as Bostrom et al. (2012) does not indicate the original order of administration. Changes to the scales and item ordering is determined in **mental-models-scales-changes.Rmd** and shown in **mental-models-scales-changes.nb.html**. The new item and orderings are presented in **mental-model-scales-study1.csv**.
