# Description of files

## Study 1

Study 1 is the free list study reported in the Supplementary Material.

* **study-1-clean.csv** is a 'cleaned' version of the data for Study 1. This data has more intuitive names.
* **study-1-list.csv** contains all participants' free list. Each concept listed by a participant has been annotated according to the codebook in **../codebook/study-1**.
* **study-1-sample_results.csv** contains the frequency from the surrogate sampling procedure described in the Supplementary Materials.
* **study-1-subsample_results.csv** contains the frequency from the surrogate subsampling procedure described in the Supplementary Materials.

## Study 2

Study 2

* **study-2-clean.csv** is a 'cleaned' version of the data for Study 2. This data has more intuitive names, and includes both Qualtrics and Q sort data.
* **study-2-cribsheet.csv** contains the z-scores and factor scores of each statement, for both Acceptors (f1) and Sceptics (f2).
* **study-2-cribsheet-f1.csv** contains the z-scores and factor scores of each statement for Acceptors (f1). The *com_f1* variable are researcher interpretations of the placement of a particular statement.
* **study-2-cribsheet-f2.csv** contains the z-scores and factor scores of each statement for Sceptics (f2). The *com_f2* variable are researcher interpretations of the placement of a particular statement.
* **study-2-factor-scores.csv** outline the z-scores and factor scores of statements from the Q sort, for both Acceptors (f1) and Sceptics (f2).
* **study-2-glm_mm_scaled.csv** contains the coefficients of the ridge regression predicting segment membership. This regression includes only mental model characteristics as predictors, and is reported in the Supplementary Materials of the paper. The file includes both the coefficients (*pred* in file) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Acceptors are denoted as *f1*, Sceptics are denoted as *f2*, Fencesitters are denoted as *f3*.
* **study-2-glm_all_scaled.csv** contains the coefficients of the ridge regression predicting segment membership. This regression includes all measured psychological characteristics as predictors, and is reported in Study 1 of the paper. The file includes both the coefficients (*pred* in file) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Acceptors are denoted as *f1*, Sceptics are denoted as *f2*, Fencesitters are denoted as *f3*.

## Study 3

Belief updating study, referred to as *Study 2* in the paper.

* **study-3-clean.csv** is a 'cleaned' version of the data for Study 3. This data has more intuitive names, and includes both Qualtrics and Q sort data.
* **study-3-cribsheet.csv** contains the z-scores and factor scores of each statement, for both Acceptors (f1) and Sceptics (f2).
* **study-3-cribsheet-f1.csv** contains the z-scores and factor scores of each statement for Acceptors (f1).
* **study-3-cribsheet-f2.csv** contains the z-scores and factor scores of each statement for Sceptics (f2).
